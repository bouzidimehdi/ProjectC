        <h2>Diamond webshop</h2>
        <p>
            The amount of diamonds you receive depend on your total purchase. We cut the the part after the period, so the amount of diamonds you receive are almost identical to the order total.<br/>
            Let's say your total cart value is €87,23, the amount of diamonds you receive is: 87<br/>
            These diamonds can be used at your next purchase for a discount. The logic behind that is as follows:
